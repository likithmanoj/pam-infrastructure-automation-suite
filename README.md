NHI Infrastructure Automation Suite

A security automation platform for provisioning, auditing, and migrating Non-Human Identities (NHIs) across cloud environments and enterprise Privileged Access Management (PAM) platforms.

Overview

NHI Infrastructure Automation Suite is a long-term engineering project focused on automating the lifecycle of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), including service accounts, machine identities, API keys, and application credentials.

The project combines Infrastructure as Code, cloud security, and Python automation to build reusable tooling inspired by real-world enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM), cloud security, and Privileged Access Management (PAM) operations.

Why This Project Exists

Enterprise environments often manage thousands of non-human identities across cloud platforms and privileged access management solutions.

These identities are frequently:

Created manually
Managed through support tickets
Audited using spreadsheets
Over-permissioned
Poorly documented
Rotated inconsistently
Difficult to migrate between PAM platforms

This project aims to automate those operational workflows using modern cloud-native technologies while following security engineering best practices.

Zero Trust
Temporary Credentials
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Reusable Automation
Environment Isolation
Modular Infrastructure
Project Goals
Automate provisioning of Non-Human Identities
Reduce manual IAM and PAM administration

Demonstrate production-oriented security engineering practices
Implement secure AWS authentication patterns
Explore migration paths between enterprise PAM platforms and cloud-native identity services
Current Status

Status: Active Development

The project is currently focused on building a production-inspired automation platform for managing Non-Human Identities across AWS and enterprise PAM ecosystems.

The AWS infrastructure foundation has been established, including secure IAM architecture, role-based authentication using AWS STS, Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, and Python automation using temporary credentials.

Future phases will expand the platform into identity auditing, CyberArk integration, migration tooling, and enterprise-scale automation workflows.
